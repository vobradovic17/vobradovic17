Hi, I'm Vladimir Obradović. 

I'm a frontend developer with proficiency in both fundamental and modern JavaScript which gives me deep understanding of under the hood functioning of different JavaScript frameworks. I have been working mostly in Vue framework and its ecosystem, and to a lesser extent in Angular with my recent focus being on React to which I plan to switch completely in the future.
